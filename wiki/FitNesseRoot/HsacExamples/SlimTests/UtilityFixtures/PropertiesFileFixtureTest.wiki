Help: Fixture to deal with .properties files
---

Properties files fixture is a specialization of !-FileFixture-! which allows [[.properties file][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.properties]] to be read.

In this sample we first create a .properties file, and then read it. In real life an existing .properties is expected to be used.

|script       |file fixture                                                   |
|set directory|http://files/test                                              |
|$props=      |create                |sample.properties|containing|wine = good|
|append       |!-#comment = ignored-!|to               |$props    |on new line|
|append       |beer:bad              |to               |$props    |on new line|

|script          |properties file fixture   |
|load values from|$props                    |
|show            |values                    |
|check           |value           |wine|good|
|check           |value           |beer|bad |
|check           |number of values|2        |
